            <p class="main-body">When one firsts envisions a programming language, there's a high likelihood they may think of
                something similar looking to C++ or Java. However, this term refers to more than just the familiar high level
                languages one is most likely to see. To understand what a programming language is, one must
                first look at the difference between a high level language and low/machine 
                level language. While a compiled format such as C++ may be quite legible to you, your CPU is bound to disagree.

            A compiler will take your code and translate it down to machine language, while an interpreted
            language will utilize its own proprietary program to carry out instructions. In both cases, the majority of 
            coding languages made will translate input to simpler and more managable code, either for the user's machine to follow
            (compiled) or for the program itself to follow (interpreted). C++, Java, and Python represent a perfect spectrum the varied
            means by which computers read programs.
